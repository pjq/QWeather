1.When search a city,but can't find it.Then you press on one day icon,the application will occur error because 
it will get the data from the null pointer.So I change to that when can't find the data,don't pass the null value to the pointer.
2.Auto save the image icon.If the icon can't be found in local,then get it from the Internet.
