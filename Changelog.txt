Description:
1.Add the QWeatherWidget,you can add it to the Desktop
2.Now I can't bind a listener to the RemoteViews,It seems so strange.So I can't do 
any more in the AppWidget Configure:
such as change the city name or show next 4 day weather information.

Description:
1.Add SearchThread extends AsyncTask to get the data from the network while showing a ProgressDialog.
2.Add synchronized(context),then the getting data thread do the work before
running other code.
3.Because the ProgressDialog will be displayed in a very shor time default,so
I add a Thread to dismiss it after sleep for a time(1500ms).

Description:
The weather data from google sometimes seems changed.The weather icon of current condition
may be null.So if it is null,use the first day's weather icon to replace it.

1.When search a city,but can't find it.Then you press on one day icon,the application will occur error because 
it will get the data from the null pointer.So I change to that when can't find the data,don't pass the null value to the pointer.
2.Auto save the image icon.If the icon can't be found in local,then get it from the Internet.
